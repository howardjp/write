write
=====

This package includes enhanced versions of 
write(1), mesg(1), and writed(8).  This software has only been tested 
with the Linux operating system, however, it should port to similar
operating systems with little trouble.

* To compile  --  make all
* To install  --  make install (you must be "root")

This is not compatible with RFC 1756, Remote Write Protocol.
