.TH WRITE 7 "October 15, 1997" "Write" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
write \- write protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
The 
.B write
protocol permits users to communicate with each other using the 
traditional UNIX 
.BR write (1)
sematics and environment.
.SH SPECIFICATIONS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
{user.X}  ::= username
.TP
{host.X}  ::= hostname
.TP
{tty.X}   ::= terminal
.TP
{lf}      ::= line feed
.PD
.SH PROTOCOL
A 
.B write
server is listens on TCP port decimal 811.  When connected to, the server
reads a line-feed terminated line of text up to 1023 bytes from the
connected client.  This line of text is in one of two very simply formats:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
{user.1}@{host.1}@{tty.1} {user.2}{lf}
.PD
.RE
.PP
or
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
{user.1}@{host.1}@{tty.1} {user.2} {tty.2}{lf}
.PD
.RE
.PP
In both of these formats 
.I {user.1}
refers to the calling user, usually their username.  The username is
immedietly followed by an '@' symbol. Similarly, 
.I {host.1}
refers to the local host of the caller, preferably the fully qualified
domain name.  If a domain name is unavailible, a numerical IP address is
sufficent.  This host name is again followed by an '@' symbol.  Finally,
the caller's terminal device name (tty) is denoted by
.IR {tty.1} .
This block should be sufficient to uniquely identify the caller to the
recipient under any circumstances.
.PP
The caller block is now followed by an undefined number of spaces (ASCII
32).  The following arguement passed is the target user's username and
is denoted by
.IR {user.1} .  
This is again followed by and unspecified number of spaces.  The final
arguement, listed as 
.IR {tty.2} ,
is the target user's terminal name (tty).  This command line is then
terminated via 
.IR {lf} ,
a line feed.
.PP
Now, the client starts reading 
.I {lf} 
terminated lines of text from the server until the server sends a line
containing a single 
.I {lf}
character.  This permits the server to send any error messages or warnings
to the caller.  Once the single 
.I {lf}
character has been received, the server then goes into receive only mode
and all new data sent from the client is displayed to the receipient.

.SH HISTORY 
The 
.B write
protocol was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as
part of Project Athena.
