.TH WRITED 8 "October 15, 1997" "Write" "Linux System Manager's Manual"
.SH NAME
writed \- network daemon for write protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B writed
[
.I \-f
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Writed 
is designed to be started from the 
.BR inetd (8) 
"super server".  
.BR Inetd (8)
should be listening on TCP port decimal 811 and 
.BR writed
expects the open socket to be connected to the standard input.  The
protocol for 
.BR write (1)
is given in 
.BR write (7).
.PP
.BR Writed 
requires an entry in 
.I /etc/services
with the following text:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
write 811/tcp
.PD
.RE
.PP
and entry in 
.I /etc/inetd.conf
with the following text:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
write stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd in.writed
.PD
.RE
.PP
.B Writed
is designed such that it does not have to run as root.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-f
Do not permit unauthenticated users to connect.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR mesg (1),
.BR write (1),
.BR write (7),
.BR identd (8)
.SH BUGS
Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally narrow-minded
TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
negotiation being sent to the server, which will foul up the command line
interpretation.  
.B Writed
should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps even respond negatively
(IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.
.SH HISTORY 
.B Writed
was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as part of
Project Athena.
